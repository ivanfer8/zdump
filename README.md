# zdump
 A Python-based real-time network traffic capture tool using Scapy. It lists available interfaces, allows filtering by IP, protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and direction (in/out), and provides live packet details. Press "q" to end capture and see an IP summary with traffic stats, ordered by importance, marking the local IP as "(Yo)."
